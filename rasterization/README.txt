I) Citations:

	1) Reading a file : http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21456198/read-from-a-local-text-file-and-update-and-updating-the-content-in-an-html-tag
	2) Lessons 4 and 6 from Learning webGL were used to start with the project. The links are as follows:
		a) http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=370 
		b) http://learningwebgl.com/blog/?p=571
		c) https://github.com/gpjt/webgl-lessons/blob/master/lesson04/index.html (Used this code as the starter code for white triangles and Blinn Phong)
		d) https://github.com/gpjt/webgl-lessons/blob/master/lesson06/index.html (Used this code as the starter code for textures amd transformations)

II) How to execute:

	Unzip the submission.zip. It has a folder called project2.Inside the folder there are 4 HTML files. 
	a) whitetriangles.html: Run this html file to get the head and vase rendered in white. The parameters in url can be modified to change the obj file.
	b) blinnphong.html: Run this html file to get the head and vase rendered using Blinn Phong illumination. The parameters in url can be modified to change the obj file.
	c) head_texture.html: Run this html file to get head with textures and transformations applied.
	d) vase_texture.html: Run this html file to get vase with textures and transformations applied.

III) Notes:
	
	In order to support multiple textures for vase, parser logic has been modified. Hence parser logic for head and vase are completely different.So, only for the textures part, head and vase have been placed in seperate HTML files head_texture.html and vase_texture.html respectively.
