II) How to execute:

	1) To see the output of the first part of the assignment i.e. rendering white triangles open the file whitetriangles.html in the folder project1.
	2) To see the output of the second part of the assignment i.e. rendering coloured triangles using Blinn Phong illumination, open the file blinnphong.html in 	   the folder project1.
	3) To change the image to be rendered, change the file name in lines 612 and 613 in blinnphong1.js and line 317 in whitetriangle.js.

III) Structure of the submission:

	1) Project1 folder has three files (whitetriangles.html, blinnphong.html and README.txt) and one folder named js.
	2) The folder js has all the obj, mtl files and the javascript source files with the names whitetriangle.js and blinnphong1.js.

NOTE:
	
	1) Even after trying to disable web security on chrome, i am getting a cross origin problem. So, i have tested the project on Mozilla Firefox and it runs perfectly.	
	2) There are lot of nested loops in the code, so the project might take upto 10 seconds to render a coloured cube and around 2 minutes to render the dolphins.
